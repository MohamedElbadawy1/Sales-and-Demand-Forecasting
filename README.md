# Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts future sales and demand based on historical data. Accurate forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies. This project follows a structured data science pipeline from data collection to model deployment and monitoring.

## Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing
### Objectives:
- Collect, explore, and preprocess sales data to prepare it for analysis and model development.

### Tasks:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Acquire sales and demand data from open sources like Kaggle, UCI, or company databases.
   - Ensure data includes sales, product details, customer info, seasonality factors, promotions, and economic indicators (e.g., holidays, weather).

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends and external influences.
   - Identify relationships between product types, promotional activities, and sales.

3. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Create time-based features (e.g., month, week, day), product categories, and promotion flags.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Use visualizations (line plots, bar charts, heatmaps) to identify trends and correlations.
   - Summarize insights for forecasting models.

### Deliverables:
- **EDA Report:** Summary of insights and preprocessing decisions.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Notebooks illustrating trends and correlations.
- **Cleaned Dataset:** Preprocessed data ready for forecasting.

## Milestone 2: Advanced Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
### Objectives:
- Perform deeper analysis and enhance feature selection to improve forecast accuracy.

### Tasks:
- Conduct time series analysis and statistical tests (e.g., ADF test for stationarity).
- Engineer rolling averages, lag features, seasonal components.
- Introduce external factors (e.g., weather, promotions) to improve accuracy.
- Build interactive dashboards for demand analysis.

### Deliverables:
- **Data Analysis Report**
- **Enhanced Visualizations**
- **Feature Engineering Summary**

## Milestone 3: Machine Learning Model Development and Optimization
### Objectives:
- Build, train, and optimize forecasting models to predict future sales and demand.

### Tasks:
- Select models (ARIMA, ETS, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM).
- Train models using cross-validation while preserving time series order.
- Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².
- Tune hyperparameters (Grid Search, Random Search).
- Compare models and select the best-performing one.

### Deliverables:
- **Model Evaluation Report**
- **Model Code**
- **Final Model**

## Milestone 4: MLOps, Deployment, and Monitoring
### Objectives:
- Implement MLOps practices and deploy the forecasting model.

### Tasks:
- Use MLflow or DVC for experiment tracking and version control.
- Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
- Optionally deploy to AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- Monitor model performance and set up retraining strategies.

### Deliverables:
- **Deployed Model**
- **MLOps Report**
- **Monitoring Setup**

## Milestone 5: Final Documentation and Presentation
### Objectives:
- Prepare final documentation and a business-focused presentation.

### Tasks:
- Summarize project workflow, business impact, and forecasting benefits.
- Demonstrate model predictions via a live demo or dashboard.
- Suggest future improvements (e.g., adding external features, testing new algorithms).

### Deliverables:
- **Final Project Report**
- **Final Presentation**

## Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Statsmodels)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment:** Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, AWS, Google Cloud
- **MLOps:** MLflow, DVC

## Installation and Usage

   ```

## Future Improvements
- Integrate competitor pricing and macroeconomic indicators.
- Experiment with deep learning models such as Transformers.
- Automate data ingestion and model retraining pipelines.
