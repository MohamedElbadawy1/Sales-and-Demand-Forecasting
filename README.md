# Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts future sales and demand for products based on historical data. Accurate forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies.

This project applies data science techniques, covering data collection, analysis, model development, deployment, and monitoring, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions.

## Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing

### Objectives
- Collect, explore, and preprocess sales data to prepare it for analysis and model development.

### Tasks
#### 1. Data Collection
- Acquire sales and demand data from open sources like Kaggle, UCI, or company databases.
- The dataset should contain:
  - Historical sales records
  - Product details
  - Customer information
  - Seasonality factors
  - Promotions
  - Economic indicators (e.g., holidays, weather conditions)

#### 2. Data Exploration
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify:
  - Sales trends
  - Seasonality patterns
  - External factors influencing demand
- Investigate relationships between:
  - Product types
  - Promotional activities
  - Sales volume
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Compute basic summary statistics.

#### 3. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Handle missing data through **imputation or removal**.
- Manage **outliers**, especially in sales data.
- Create relevant features:
  - **Time-based features** (e.g., month, week, day)
  - **Product categories**
  - **Promotion flags**
- Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
- Generate **lag features** (e.g., sales from the previous month).

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Create visualizations to identify trends and correlations:
  - **Line plots** for sales trends over time.
  - **Bar charts** for product category performance.
  - **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis.
- Analyze the impact of promotions on sales.
- Summarize key insights to inform forecasting models.
